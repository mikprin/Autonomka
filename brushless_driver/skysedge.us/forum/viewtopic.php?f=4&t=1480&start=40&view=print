				<div class="content">That's a really useful tip on the lettering - thank you. In-filling is now my preferred method, I can re-print just the buttons for my last (spare) case.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Re display reliability (bending the display):</strong><br>
A reply I was about to post in 'Firmware stuff' might be useful. I think it's more appropriate if I post it here because it's a hardware rather than firmware issue.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>So much improved functionality since last check in....now to start bending the display!</div></blockquote>

What worked for me (no artifacts):<br>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>Each day increase the bend while continuously updating the display. I used a weak elastic band for easy adjustment but beware there are thin film electronics on the transparent edge. The elastic band must be weak enough that it is barely capable of fully bending the display (I guess I was lucky I had one). When lines start to appear, back off until the display is normal again</li>

<li>Repeat until the display is almost at 90 deg (it might take a week). Now you know the display will be fine, even though it was disturbingly sensitive at first</li>

<li>Let the display return upright (this quickly resets what you achieved over the past week) and apply the 3M tape, remove all tape backing. I use just one 15mm wide strip, no need to go overboard. Note if you are using a Waveshare display you must leave the labels on (I destroyed two Waveshare displays removing the labels).</li>

<li> Repeat (1) until the display is fully attached to the 3M tape.</li></ol>

For reliability the two case halves must mate flush or the display will be subject to stress along the join line. The problem is mainly dial differences but the case will fit perfectly with a little extra care:<br>

<ul>
<li>The dial screws nearest the battery; some are cheesehead (2mm high), some are domed cheesehead (2.8mm high). I ground these screw heads to 1.8mm height</li>
<li>Does the dial fit snugly and plane to the board? Is dial plastic sitting on a capacitor? If so, consider removing some plastic above the component</li>
<li>Does the board and dial fit snuggly against all the pillars in the case top half? Does part of the case above the slide switches need scraping away to achieve this? Probably about 1mm (depending on the switch type)</li>
<li>Is a case pillar sitting on a push button switch connection (probably slightly) or any other component (two are close)? If so consider chamfering the pillar so the board sits flush on all pillars.</li>
</ul>

I hope this helps, like most here I'm learning as I go along.</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for my lack of posting for a while! I am onto the soldering. I am getting some help with it and my ‘help’ has asked a question I don’t know the answer to:<br>
The resistors are 2k ohm and in the circuit we have 470 ohm. These are usually used for LED power if I use them the LED would have less intensive light. Is this correct?</div>
