				<div class="content">Hey everyone, Aussie guy here. I have my dial and my case but COVID19 has somewhat stopped me from getting some BOM and the PCB. <br>
When this craziness is over I hope to complete my rotary dial phone but I’m chipping away at it a little bit at a time. <br>

				<div class="content">Tactical black, I like it! So we have one RotaryCell in the UK (mine), one in Australia... one good thing to rapidly spreading around the world!<br>
<br>
Yeah tell me about the delays, it's frustrating. I have the board and most SMT parts now but I fear my tools at home aren't appropriate. I'm waiting for my local Hackspace to re-open.<br>
<br>
I have an idea; I ordered 10 boards but I only need 2-3 (I'm going to donate a space model phone for display in a Hackspace). <strong class="text-strong">Owlwarrior:</strong> if you trust me with your address (via private message), I'll be happy to mail a board to you. It's my way of paying back to the community. Postal services are working in the UK, how about Australia?</div>

That’s very kind of you! Postage services in Australia are slow but working. I don’t want to take away from Justine’s business though.  I’ll drop you a PM. <br>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Owlwarrior:</strong> bare board is on it's way to you (only 19g, small letter). I just got the microcontroller working on mine. A huge relief after soldering the 0.5mm pitch ATmega2560 at home <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
The bootloader programmed first time with a Bus Pirate. Then I uploaded firmware via the USB (photos shows Rx/Tx LEDs on while programming), also good but USB Vbus only goes to the Tx/Rx LEDs and Fona, so without the Fona I needed the battery to power the board during programming. I guess the Fona supplies battery charging power... I need to check this out.<br>
<br>
I forgot this version of the board (Feb 2020) uses different switches. <strong class="text-strong">Owlwarrior:</strong> I recommend you hold off buying the switches in the BoM and try to source the vertical 'parts drawer' switches you see in Justine's video (22:34).<br>

Thanks a lot Justine, it's all going smoothly so far.<br>
Sorry I ditched the New Hampshire-esq motto but I would never ditch the attribution.</div>

				<div class="content">I found the 'parts drawer' switches used on the earlier versions of board (without the Sky'sEDGE logo), available from Mouser (note the mounting lugs should be cut off):<br>

Mfr.:      C&amp;K Switches<br>
Mfr. No: OS102011MS2QN1<br>

If the board has holes for switch mounting lugs, you need the part numbers for right angled switches specified in the BoM (extracted from the schematic).</div>

I’m looking for the OUMEX $20 one from mouser.com Justine used in her build video.</div>

Note the pin number ordering of the phone's ISP socket (sketched in pencil).<br>
<br>
The $20 Olimex AVR-ISP-Mk2 programmer looks good value and ultra easy to use - a safe choice.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi from Canada,<br>
<br>
Some trouble getting all of the parts together with current state of the world.....I did buy one of Justine’s kits as my abilities do not extend to PCboard fabrication. <br>
<br>
BUT as of this morning the FONA board is blinking and sort of receives calls. Assuming that the “ringing” is coming from the little speaker,  and I haven’t broken the top part of the board, someone can call me. I cannot answer the call however. <br>
<br>
The side LEDs work with dialing but no sound from the speaker either with the dialing or with trying to place a call by pressing the hook button either. <br>
<br>
So....fun parts done, now have to get the functional parts working. <br>
<br>
Just wondering if anyone has some “simple” troubleshooting ideas....I am not an “electronical engineer”.<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>
Simon</div>
