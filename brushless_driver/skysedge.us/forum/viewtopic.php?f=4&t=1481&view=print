				<div class="content">Hi folks. Does anyone have any contacts for suppliers of the rotary dial here in the U.K. Alternatively, what UK phones to search for on eBay?<br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi there is no UK version of this compact dial and there are many subtle variations in the Western Digital 10A dial. Therefore I think it's too risky to order from US sellers on eBay, considering shipping, VAT and Royal Mail's £8 handling fee. There's a significant risk you will receive an incompatible dial.<br>
<br>
So I 'bite the bullet' and buy a refurbished, known compatible dial from oldphoneworks.com. The proprietor, Matt is very helpful and sold me an additional cheap, non-working dial I can give away as a display model for my local Hackspace. He says he has plenty of compatible dials but I noticed the price went up from $35 in February.<br>
<br>
Oh, and by standard, Matt ships by Canada Post, generally cheaper than US services plus it gets handled our side by Royal Mail. Other couriers charge higher duty handling fees (DHL £11, Fedex - can't remember but I think it's something extortionate).<br>
