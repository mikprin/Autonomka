Wow this is an old post, darn. Sorry.<br><br>Yes, I use Simplify3D, but it's hard to encapsulate settings in a single screenshot. Do you use that? If so I'll attached my FFF file for reference. I've also noticed that some brands up PLA are too gummy. Actually, cheaper PLA is typically better here as the stuff marketed as high strength tends is also less stiff in equal meausure, and the more brittle, the easier the support will remove.<br><br>If you're into black, protopasta's carbon-filled PLA is the best, btw. Amazing surface finish and print quality, and the support falls off like butter. Needs a hardened nozzle though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">justine</a> — Fri May 22, 2020 9:48 pm</p><hr />

Hi Justine,<br><br>I have been printing the enclosure with single-material support PLA and so far I have been unable to come close to the easy breakaway of the support material you show in your video.  Would you mind sharing the name of the slicer you have been using and maybe a screenshot of the support settings? <br><br>Thanks a bunch,<br><br>Charles<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1745">nemomtt</a> — Tue May 05, 2020 11:16 pm</p><hr />

Yeah it is a lot of work, I would never sell them. This is the first time I smoothed &amp; painted a 3D print so it was part experiment for me - I'm very pleased with the result. I recommend the UV set resin windows.<br><br>For me it's worth the effort, your design is so cool for many reasons... and don't get me started on long-term RF exposure at 2.1 &amp; 2.6GHz next to the skin. Constant smartphone background transmissions. No, don't get me started! No! Lot's of other cool factors to talk about.<br><br>The clip is a great idea, nice, I can guess it's in the corner without a screw, next to the earphone jack. I don't regret I missed the clip version, the current design is surprisingly firm once assembled plus I'll want to make spares. I intend to use this as my main phone and, well, it's bound to get dropped at some point.<br><br>My PCBs were delivered 8 April, my bad, I should have paid for higher priority shipping than e-Packet and it was partly held up due to the pandemic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1724">SteveC</a> — Sat Apr 18, 2020 2:05 pm</p><hr />

Thanks, and thanks for the comment re. attention to detail. It looks like you're putting a LOT of work into the enclosure. Now, I hate to say it but I added a clip feature to help hold the two halves together along the edge that doesn't have any screw holes and I haven't updated the online files yet. It's okay without it but once I thought of it and added it to the design I was really glad I did. Ack, sorry!<br><br>Importantly, has the order status been updated yet?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">justine</a> — Fri Apr 17, 2020 12:43 am</p><hr />

Thanks Justine, I have SolidWorks and Inventor at work, FreeCAD at home (sort of a 'jack of all trades but master of none')! I understand your approach now and it inspires me to up my 3D modelling game. Please accept a quart of outreach points <img class="smilies" src="http://skysedge.us/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br><br>It is an awesome design, so much attention to detail: e.g. the 0.6 x 0.56mm channel above the signal strength cutout to hold the clear plastic.<br><br>I used PLA on the failed MakerBot attempt. I would try again with 'normal' 0.15mm layer height but the Hackspace where I do this is closed for the current lockdown. My second case was printed on a Stratasys uPrint with ABS and soluble support, 0.15mm layer height. That came out well. It's probably a little more flexible than PLA but I'm pleased with it except for the colour (clue to my country) - Stratasys ivory - the model T Ford of 3D printers! I prefer your 60s colours, so I'm sanding, filling (acrylic putty), and painting my case (Plastikote). I hope you don't mind a small photo:<br><div class="inline-attachment"><dl class="file"><dt class="attach-image"><img src="http://skysedge.us/forum/download/file.php?id=2" class="postimage" alt="first_primer_coat_sanded_sm.jpg" onclick="viewableArea(this);" /></dt></dl></div>Motor back EMF: I'm sure it won't be hard to fix but it's going to be a few weeks until I receive my PCBs and can test the circuit. The order tracking has been stuck at 'Item leaving overseas' for the past 20 days, enough to test the patience of even an RF engineer! I could simulate..... depends how long the boards take.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1724">SteveC</a> — Wed Apr 01, 2020 3:03 pm</p><hr />

1. <br>Thanks. I use Autodesk Inventor. I don't usually design such curvey things and admittedly I remodeled the enclosure a few times before figuring out what I wanted to do. The front piece isn't as exotic as it might seem. Starting with a basic extrusion, subtracting a revolution is how I made the top surface:<br><br><a href="http://skysedge.us/misc/PhoneRevolve.png" class="postlink">http://skysedge.us/misc/PhoneRevolve.png</a><br><br>Most everything else is a basic extrusion, and I used Inventor's "shell" feature to hollow it out.<br><br>However, the back piece is totally kludged. I played around with some lofting but I can count the number of times that's worked out for me (ever) on one hand. I wound up cutting into it from different directions set up by work planes with extrusions, then smoothing everything with fillets. In hindsight it's amazing it looks as much like a loft as it does. The shell cut was important here too.<br><br>2.<br>What material are you using? What's shown in the video is just PLA, which is easy to work with in terms of support. I wouldn't even attempt it with single-material support in PETG or polycarbonate. I wouldn't expect layer height o make a big difference.<br><br>3.<br>I think the back-EMF from the motor is frying the output pin on the MCU, and I really should have used an N-channel device to drive it. On the next version of the phone I'm thinking of doing something even more exotic involving a solenoid-driven hammer for an actual mechanical bell. The bell would be physically moved away from the hammer for volume control, and when completely out of contact it will be a vibration mode.<br><br>4. <br>I use these: <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/94180a307" class="postlink">https://www.mcmaster.com/94180a307</a><br>For that piece I was being careful not to impinge on the clearance for the SMA connector and the threaded insert is in fact a bit thicker than the plastic, but it doesn't matter, considering where it is, and I've had no problems the robustness of that connection.<br><br>Steve, I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes for you!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">justine</a> — Tue Mar 31, 2020 8:12 pm</p><hr />

I learned of this phone through a one line post in a Hackspace forum on 18 February (not realising it was already well publicised). I was fascinated, started studying but I was left with some important questions: "What are the windows for?" (obvious now - LEDs!), "What are the screw fixings?". <strong class="text-strong">Then came Justine's video and all critical questions were answered - I decided to build</strong>  <img class="smilies" src="http://skysedge.us/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br><br>What's left are a few non-critical questions that won't stop me building but leave me curious:<br><ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>Very impressive case design, I'm fascinated to know what CAD software was used. Any brief tip on the method used for the curved surfaces (surface lofting?) would be appreciated?</li><li>I'm impressed how easily the support material pulled away in your video. I tried a 3D print with a single printhead (MakerBot) but the support was too tough (I used that print for scrap, testing window in-fills). My mistake might be I used the fine setting (0.1mm layers) and/or the printer was setup incorrectly. Does this make sense? Any special setting tweaks? Fortunately I could call in a favour and had a case printed with disolvable support material.</li><li>Did the problem with the vibration motor get solved? I checked the schematic and board traces - can't see anything wrong. (I don't count this as critical because it should be easy to fault find, given time and an oscilloscope).</li><li>I think there is a hole for a threaded insert close to the two SMA clamp inserts but it's only 2.5mm deep. Is this for a threaded insert? If so, what length of insert did you use there.</li></ol><em class="text-italics">Many thanks,<br>--Steve</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1724">SteveC</a> — Tue Mar 31, 2020 3:21 pm</p><hr />
