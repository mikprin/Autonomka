Sorry for my lack of posting for a while! I am onto the soldering. I am getting some help with it and my ‘help’ has asked a question I don’t know the answer to:<br>The resistors are 2k ohm and in the circuit we have 470 ohm. These are usually used for LED power if I use them the LED would have less intensive light. Is this correct?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1746">Owlwarrior</a> — Tue Aug 11, 2020 3:49 am</p><hr />

SteveC,<br>For the lettering, I modified the STL model and added the negative indentation for the lettering using a boolean difference method. After printing I sprayed a small amount of flat black paint into a cup and used a small syringe to insert the paint in the indentations.  After the paint is dry I carefully removed any excess paint with a small amount of brake cleaner and or light sanding.  I printed the case with SpiderMaker 3D Premium Matte PLA+ Filament.  This PLA is very good for reworking.<br><br>Thank you for your insight on laying down the e-paper display.  To tell the truth I have had very poor luck with the e-paper displays.  It is a shame because the bistatic technology is very cool. I have tried to be very careful while installing to e-paper, however, my failure rate is very high. In fact, the one you see on the phone was my third attempt, and that one failed five days after it was installed. I am waiting till I have serval on hand before open the case and try again.  I have some coming in from China as no distributor in the US has any in stock.  I am assuming that the failure rate has something to do with this shortage. I am hoping that Justine comes up with something a little more stable for her next design as she is a brilliant engineer and this seems to be the only hardware issue with this design.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1745">nemomtt</a> — Wed Jun 10, 2020 5:51 pm</p><hr />

Ooops my previous post came out 20-30dB more critical than intended, sorry. I'm in awe of the design and want to change it as little as possible. I imagine me showing the phone in a few years proudly declaring I have one of Justine's original rotary cell phone designs.<br><br>So I forked the repository and am now considering the best route; simplest fix possible, incorporate the GSMSim library, or fork GSMSim and change the dependency on the reset line... not sure yet.

Thanks Simon, you prompted me to post my code in 'Firmware Stuff'.<br><br>I thought of asking Justine if I could contribute on GitHub but I fear I might end up breaking stuff. I already use a different FONA baud rate (9600) and a different hardware pin for FONA receive. The current code is great in that it does what it says, it's a working start, and the rotary dial code works well but it's not a strong foundation for development. Ideally we need a new parsing engine for FONA messages, like the method used by Mikal Hart for TinyGPS++ (where, if available, a character is 'fed' to a parsing engine once per iteration of the main loop). Sorry I digress, I can't do this on my own, even Mikal acknowledges help.<br><br>I've been getting my displays from here, surprisingly fast:<br><a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32960168615.html" class="postlink">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32960168615.html</a><br>As far as I can tell the Waveshare displays are identical to the Dalian Good Display one but come with stickers on the back - don't try to remove them!<br><br>Tips: if you push the end of the display along it's length you can bend it further. Use the absolute minimum epoxy possible, tape a 29mm wide L-shaped plastic guide to the back to help align the display before the epoxy sets... but we'll probably have to accept some artifacts, I call it character, the distressed look!<br><br>Cheers<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1724">SteveC</a> — Tue May 19, 2020 3:07 pm</p><hr />

Steve,<br><br>Congratulations!  Those guys look great.....looks like you can have your own network going. <br><br>I would love to have the time function working as that is the only section of my display that remains functional. I was trying to get the bend on the display "just right" for no artefact but blew it/broke it and "just a phone" again.  Still though creates a stir when I pull it out at work to make a call. <br><br>Excellent writeup on the pointers. I am trying to figure out some of the call contact functionality, a bit hard with the top half of the display buggered. I am following along on the firmware progress....will you be posting your updates?<br><br>So will be ordering a new display (maybe a couple) to get this all going properly.  Will stick with one for the local market!  <br>Cheers<br>Simon<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1748">paedipod</a> — Tue May 19, 2020 11:55 am</p><hr />

That's really good good to see. While I was stuck without a decent soldering station during, lockdown, seeing progress like this inspires.<br><br>A few pointers in case it helps and in no particular order:<ul><li>The mic needs to be stuck down with something or the exposed pads could short something out.</li><li>There's a knack to getting everything inside but once mastered it's easy. Take your time and plan the antenna cable route. Tip: lightly hold the battery from rotating with a piece of masking tape.</li><li>For the case to close fully, the gap between PCB &amp; dial (under the '4') should be only 3-4mm (with only slight pressure on the dial). To achieve this you'll probably need to 'Dremel' off the top tab and a cut-out for the power switch. As a test, insert the assembly into the top cover and check the PCB can rest on the pillars next to the Clear &amp; Hook buttons (slight dial pressure is OK).</li><li>There's a minor issue with the 'February edition' case which could snag and break the speaker connections if not careful when (dis)connecting the ePaper. If the case surrounds the speaker on all 4 sides, cut down the side nearest the dial to allow the speaker to slide into place. This has been done with the 'April edition'.</li><li>Use the absolute minimum epoxy for the display. Check epoxy hasn't filled the cut-out where the FPC stiffener should go - that bit of space is very important.</li><li>Don't underestimate what Justine said about taking time with the display bend. I couldn't find a bending spec from Dalian Good Display Co. but I found one for the the similar Waveshare display I use. Click the resources tab here: <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT_%28D%29" class="postlink">https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT_(D)</a>. Yes, a minimum bend radius of 5cm! Take it real slow and easy. Oh and if your display has labels on the back (Waveshare), leave them on! Organic solvents like isopropanol destroys them.</li><li>Firmware updates, I believe the phone can do a lot more. I posted an example of the battery meter fix to show a new way to parse the FONA's messages. This method could be applied to other functions too. I've also got the FONA to set it's RTC from the network and send date and time over the debugging USB... BUT first it's necessary to improve reliability of the FONA to ATmega communication and perhaps improve the FONAserialReceive() function (it can return a lot of junk!). I'm taking a break from this for a while, I hope someone else can contribute here.</li><li>In the meantime the phone can certainly make and receive phone calls - which is what it's all about.
