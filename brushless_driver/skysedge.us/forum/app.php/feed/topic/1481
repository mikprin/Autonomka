Hi there is no UK version of this compact dial and there are many subtle variations in the Western Digital 10A dial. Therefore I think it's too risky to order from US sellers on eBay, considering shipping, VAT and Royal Mail's £8 handling fee. There's a significant risk you will receive an incompatible dial.<br><br>So I 'bite the bullet' and buy a refurbished, known compatible dial from oldphoneworks.com. The proprietor, Matt is very helpful and sold me an additional cheap, non-working dial I can give away as a display model for my local Hackspace. He says he has plenty of compatible dials but I noticed the price went up from $35 in February.<br><br>Oh, and by standard, Matt ships by Canada Post, generally cheaper than US services plus it gets handled our side by Royal Mail. Other couriers charge higher duty handling fees (DHL £11, Fedex - can't remember but I think it's something extortionate).<br><br><em class="text-italics">All opinions expressed here are my own and come with a non-zero probability I could be completely wrong.</em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1724">SteveC</a> — Sat Apr 18, 2020 2:48 pm</p><hr />

Hi folks. Does anyone have any contacts for suppliers of the rotary dial here in the U.K. Alternatively, what UK phones to search for on eBay?<br><br>Cheers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://skysedge.us/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">AndrewL</a> — Sat Apr 18, 2020 9:07 am</p><hr />
