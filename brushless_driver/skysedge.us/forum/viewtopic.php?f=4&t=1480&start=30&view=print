				<div class="content">Yeah I can imagine there must be some big potential collaborators lining up. I look forward to more news... meanwhile an announcement:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">SteveC is proud to announce the arrival of healthy twins last Friday.</strong> They weighed in at 188 and 199g and are both doing well. They are already talking to each other, one has learned to tell the time. The first to arrive (dessert yellow) is yet to be named, the other is 'Flamingo Fone'<br>

Congratulations!  Those guys look great.....looks like you can have your own network going. <br>
<br>
I would love to have the time function working as that is the only section of my display that remains functional. I was trying to get the bend on the display "just right" for no artefact but blew it/broke it and "just a phone" again.  Still though creates a stir when I pull it out at work to make a call. <br>
<br>
Excellent writeup on the pointers. I am trying to figure out some of the call contact functionality, a bit hard with the top half of the display buggered. I am following along on the firmware progress....will you be posting your updates?<br>
<br>
So will be ordering a new display (maybe a couple) to get this all going properly.  Will stick with one for the local market!  <br>
Cheers<br>
Simon</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Simon, you prompted me to post my code in 'Firmware Stuff'.<br>
<br>
I thought of asking Justine if I could contribute on GitHub but I fear I might end up breaking stuff. I already use a different FONA baud rate (9600) and a different hardware pin for FONA receive. The current code is great in that it does what it says, it's a working start, and the rotary dial code works well but it's not a strong foundation for development. Ideally we need a new parsing engine for FONA messages, like the method used by Mikal Hart for TinyGPS++ (where, if available, a character is 'fed' to a parsing engine once per iteration of the main loop). Sorry I digress, I can't do this on my own, even Mikal acknowledges help.<br>
<br>
I've been getting my displays from here, surprisingly fast:<br>
<a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32960168615.html" class="postlink">https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32960168615.html</a><br>
As far as I can tell the Waveshare displays are identical to the Dalian Good Display one but come with stickers on the back - don't try to remove them!<br>
<br>
Tips: if you push the end of the display along it's length you can bend it further. Use the absolute minimum epoxy possible, tape a 29mm wide L-shaped plastic guide to the back to help align the display before the epoxy sets... but we'll probably have to accept some artifacts, I call it character, the distressed look!<br>
<br>
Cheers</div>

<br>
Steve, what about a git fork under your own name or something? I would endorse that wholeheartedly and even put a link in the docs. You can tell that programming isn't my "main thing" and I'm okay with that.</div>

				<div class="content">Ooops my previous post came out 20-30dB more critical than intended, sorry. I'm in awe of the design and want to change it as little as possible. I imagine me showing the phone in a few years proudly declaring I have one of Justine's original rotary cell phone designs.<br>
<br>
So I forked the repository and am now considering the best route; simplest fix possible, incorporate the GSMSim library, or fork GSMSim and change the dependency on the reset line... not sure yet. Suggestions welcome.</div>

				<div class="content">Very nice, thank you for sharing this. It looks like you've recessed the text and in-filled with colour. I'm very interested to know your technique.<br>
<br>
I've gone off dry transfers and lacquer because the bond is weak underneath the transfer, pieces of transfer come off eventually.<br>
<br>
Thanks again</div>

				<div class="content">Oh BTW a few days ago I got the e-paper fully stuck down without a single artifact  <img class="smilies" src="./images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="17" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
I noticed you could slowly decrease the bend radius over a few days but as soon as the curve was released to apply 3M double sided tape, the previous curving was was lost. It seems the e-paper can reset its curve memory in seconds.<br>
<br>
What worked for me; position the 3M double-sided tape and remove the backing, slowly decrease the e-paper bend radius over several days (as per Justine's video), keep going until all the tape is in contact with the e-paper - done!</div>

				<div class="content">SteveC,<br>
For the lettering, I modified the STL model and added the negative indentation for the lettering using a boolean difference method. After printing I sprayed a small amount of flat black paint into a cup and used a small syringe to insert the paint in the indentations.  After the paint is dry I carefully removed any excess paint with a small amount of brake cleaner and or light sanding.  I printed the case with SpiderMaker 3D Premium Matte PLA+ Filament.  This PLA is very good for reworking.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your insight on laying down the e-paper display.  To tell the truth I have had very poor luck with the e-paper displays.  It is a shame because the bistatic technology is very cool. I have tried to be very careful while installing to e-paper, however, my failure rate is very high. In fact, the one you see on the phone was my third attempt, and that one failed five days after it was installed. I am waiting till I have serval on hand before open the case and try again.  I have some coming in from China as no distributor in the US has any in stock.  I am assuming that the failure rate has something to do with this shortage. I am hoping that Justine comes up with something a little more stable for her next design as she is a brilliant engineer and this seems to be the only hardware issue with this design.</div>
