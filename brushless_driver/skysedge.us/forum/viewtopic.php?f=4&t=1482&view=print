				<div class="content">Hey everyone,<br>
<br>
I am attempting to generate the BOM parts list from Kicad/PCBnew and upload it to Digikey Electronics.<br>
<br>
From PCBnew, I am going to File &gt; Fabrication Outputs &gt; BOMfile and creating the .csv file.<br>
When going to BOM manager on Digikey.com and attempting to upload,  I get a message saying "The uploaded file was not a supported file type. Supported types are: .xls, .xlsx, .csv, .txt".<br>
<br>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br>
<br>

<br>
I think you're trying to export the BoM from the PCB Layout Editor. I just tried this for the first time and the CSV export was a mess - I'm not going to try and fault find because another method works well.<br>
<br>
I export BoMs from the Schematic Layout Editor (logical to me since this is where component values are entered). Click the BoM symbol in the schematic editor. Now the fun part but you only need to do this once; click the '+' button to add a BoM template and navigate to:<br>
    C:\Program Files\KiCad\bin\scripting\plugins\          (yeah I'm hampered by Windows, sorry)<br>
Look for Python scripts and select one (these are the BoM format templates) then click 'Generate'.</div>

				<div class="content">KiCad has come a long way but I personally don't like that they rely on external BOM generation scripts to generate CSVs, and on Linux none seem to get installed by default.<br>
<br>
I recently learned of another way of getting a BOM out of it that's actually pretty easy, but you'd never really think to do it this way. In the schematic editor go to Tools &gt; Edit Symbol Fields. This presents you with a spreadsheet which is in effect a BOM, and you can pick and choose what fields you want with the left pane. To extract it I just select all and paste into a spreadsheet or text editor. <br>
<br>
It's meant for editing symbol values all in one place of course (changes propagate back to the schematic), which is also handy.</div>
